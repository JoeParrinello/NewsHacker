# NewsHacker

An Android application for [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) that I'm developing in my spare time.

### Planned Features
- View trending Hacker News articles.
- Search by article name
- View user profiles

### General Goals
I've been developing Android apps for some time but don't have any open source ones I can show off. This project aims to fix that. I'm shooting for excellence in design and architecture here, while leveraging the ability to start from scratch and make something great using all of the latest & greatest tools and libraries.
